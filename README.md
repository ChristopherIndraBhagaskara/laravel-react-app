-   Connected to external APIs to fetch and display data.
-   Implemented authentication mechanisms to handle user login/logout.

### Laravel

-   Created secure Login and Registration API endpoints.
-   Implemented basic CRUD API endpoints for data manipulation.
-   Utilized Form Requests for validating and handling incoming data.
-   Created API Resources for transforming data before sending responses.
-   Deployed the application in a production environment.
-   Used SSH for remote server access and deployment.
-   Managed version control with Git, including cloning repositories.
